I combine strong domain knowledge with technology expertise to build and maintain the best web applications for clients, whether the need is for B2B or B2C audiences.
My expertise covers the entire spectrum of application types â€“ from Single Page Applications (SPAs) which I develop with React.js, Vue.js or Angular to quick prototyping and mid-level web applications using Ruby on Rails or Laravel, and full enterprise-level applications using Java.
Combined with expert knowledge in CSS3 and HTML5, I am equipped to make your application look elegant and provide a slick user experience.
